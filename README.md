## About me - what I do (explanation)

I build full-stack applications and APIs with an emphasis on **type safety, reliability, and clear architecture**. I focus on modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks and backend services in Node.js and Go. My work emphasizes:

- **Readable, testable code** (unit + integration tests)
- **Production-minded deployments** (Docker, CI/CD)
- **Clear documentation and reproducible examples** for reviewers

**Why this profile exists:** to provide verifiable evidence (projects, code, demos) that demonstrates technical competence and readiness for remote roles and university scholarship review.
